# ![Feedly tabs icon](images/icon38.png) Feedly tabs for Firefox

##Firefox Fork

This is a novice port of the Feedly tabs browser-extension from Chrome to Firefox Quantum (FFQ). Since the old Firefox version of Feedly tabs isn't compatible with FFQ and overall compatibility between Chrome and FFQ is very high, it made sense to just adapt the newer Chrome version.

For now, this underwent almost no testing. Basic functionality (open read later items in new tabs) worked like expected.
I hope this can find its way in the official Firefox add-on repository. *


*respectfully I will try to contact splattael about that; if without success the MIT licence does allow to submit it as a third party
